4;Back to school: Attention, surprise children;"School starts on Monday, August 10, 2020 in the city of St.Gallen and children can be found on their way to school again. The campaign for the way to school is under the motto ""Attention children, surprise"". The St.Gallen City Police is increasingly present during the first week of school and asks road users to be particularly careful. School or kindergarten begins for the children on Monday, August 10, 2010. That's why they're on their way to school or home again. Children have a different perception than adults and are not yet able to assess dangers immediately. Sometimes they are unpredictable and can surprise you. Therefore, double attention is required for road users. The St.Gallen City Police asks you to be particularly careful, especially when children are nearby. St.Gallen City Police supports the national school commute campaign, which has the motto “Be careful, surprise children”. In addition to car stickers on civilian cars, posters and banners are also hung in the city of St.Gallen. In addition, employees of the St.Gallen City Police are out and about on the streets near schools during the first week of school to ensure the safety of the children and to help them across the street."

26;Pay for EBZ day permits with TWINT;St.Gallen is the first Swiss city to introduce a new payment method for day permits in all Extended Blue Zones (EBZ). It is now possible to use the TWINT app to pay for one-day parking permits in EBZ car parks in the city of St.Gallen. After the St.Gallen city police introduced the TWINT app as a payment method for parking fees in white parking spaces in November 2018 they now continue to offer their services. As the first city in Switzerland, St.Gallen is now able to pay for EBZ day permits with the TWINT app. Since the EBZ is very extensive and there is usually no possibility of attaching the QR code, the St.Gallen City Police have created printed matter with the corresponding QR codes. The QR codes are available on cards, stickers and parking discs at the police station at Vadianstrasse 57 and at the inner city police contact point at 5 Neugasse. You can also download the QR code from the City of St.Gallen website or obtain it from the security assistant and the district police. The permit can now be obtained by scanning the QR code with the TWINT app. In the background, the payment is processed using the proven cashless ParkingPay system. A one-time specification of the license plate is required as part of the TWINT payment. This is used to check whether parking has been paid for. A permit can then be purchased for the current day. With the introduction of TWINT as an additional payment option, added value is created for both residents and guests, as daily permits can now also be paid in the EBZ even more easily without cash. The conventional payment methods will continue to be used. Image 1: Scan the QR code TWINT QR code and instructions.pdf

143;Three cantons and the city of St.Gallen are jointly planning an emergency call and control system;Anyone who dials an emergency number is connected to the emergency call and control system of the respective police force. The cantons of St.Gallen, Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Appenzell Innerrhoden and the city of St.Gallen have now agreed to operate a joint system in the future. and control system. With this system they process all emergency calls and provide their police officers with information. The canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden is also involved as a client, and indirectly the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, which receives these services from the Appenzell Ausserrhoden canton police. The system now has to be renewed because it is at the end of the technical cycle. The governments of the cantons concerned and the city of St.Gallen have therefore decided to jointly tackle the renewal of the emergency call and operations control system and to put it out to public tender. The new operations control and information system is operated in a secure data center. The cantons and the city are not building this themselves, but intend to purchase the service on the market by means of a tender. Open to other police forces The project includes all security and rescue tasks and takes into account all emergency numbers (112, 117, 118 and 144). In the future, if someone calls an emergency number from the city of St. Gallen, Appenzell or Herisau, for example, the system automatically forwards the emergency call to the responsible police force. The workplaces of the police officers therefore do not have to be centralized, but can be kept at their respective main locations. In future, the Appenzell Innerrhoden canton police will also receive their services directly from the St.Gallen canton police. The canton of Appenzell Ausserhoden, in turn, continues to participate as an independent partner in the planned intercantonal project. The same applies to the city of St.Gallen, which has already agreed to the joint solution. Further corps can join. Temporary solution in Lerchenfeld Parallel to the procurement of the new system, a spatial expansion of the emergency call and operations center of the St.Gallen cantonal police is necessary. Because the property in the cloister courtyard does not offer enough space to provide the required number of workplaces. Until the canton of St.Gallen has implemented the security and administration center on the Armstrong site in the west of the city of St.Gallen, an interim solution is therefore necessary. It is planned to set up this interim solution in the Lerchenfeld area. This is expected to be the case in autumn 2024. This interim solution will remain in place at least until the new security and administration center is moved into. The government of the canton of St.Gallen wants to build the security and administration center by 2033. It wants to bring together the more than twenty locations in the city of St. The spatial merger promises better cooperation between the various institutions, more efficient processes and cost savings. In autumn / winter 2021, the corresponding loan resolutions should then be applied for from the responsible political bodies so that the implementation phase can start in winter 2021. The introduction of the new, joint emergency call and operations control system is planned for the course of 2024.

172;Kick-off for cooperation in the public space of the city of St.Gallen;"The kick-off for collaboration in public space took place on Friday, March 26, 2021. Since public space belongs to everyone, it must enable an undisturbed social life. To this end, the St.Gallen City Police, the Addiction Aid Foundation and the Child Youth Family Office of the City of St.Gallen presented the common goals for the year 2021.The annual kick-off for cooperation in the public space of the City of St.Gallen took place on Friday, March 26, 2021. Due to the corona measures that continue to apply, the rising temperatures are likely to result in more people in public places than in previous years. It is therefore important that these places are accessible to all persons, while observing the protective measures. That is why the St.Gallen City Police, in close cooperation with the Child Youth Family Service and the Addiction Aid Foundation, defined the goals for the public space again this year. Because this belongs to everyone and must enable an undisturbed social life. Therefore, places that are perceived as unsafe should be made safe again. This can be done in the following ways, among others: ▪ Dialogue (relationship and prevention work) and support with user and interest groups; ▪ Controlling or directing people who claim certain places too much or even exclusively for themselves; ▪ Bringing these places to life other population groups or even with structural measures Since every place is different, no general measures are taken, but each situation is assessed individually. There should be scope for proportionate measures or targeted deployment options by the various parties. Regular and institutionalized exchange between the St.Gallen City Police, the Child Youth Family Service and the Addiction Aid Foundation is important. Challenges in public space can only be tackled quickly and purposefully together. City councilor Sonja Lüthi stated at the kick-off: ""The use of public space requires mutual consideration and tolerance."""

179;St.Gallen should remain peaceful;Last Friday, March 26, 2021, there were riots in downtown St.Gallen with high levels of property damage. The city council strongly condemns the violence. Nevertheless, he understands the frustration of the young people and the difficult situation for the entire population. It is now a matter of staying calm and sticking together. On Friday, March 26, 2021, an illegal party with over 200 young people escalated on the Red Square in St.Gallen. Violence was called in advance. The rioters left property damage of several tens of thousands of francs. In addition, a policeman was injured and had to be treated in the hospital. The city council understands the difficult situation for the entire population. Social contacts have not been maintained in the same way for over a year and leisure opportunities are limited. But now we all have to stick together to overcome the crisis together. Violence and property damage are not the solution. Rather, it damages people, businesses or catering establishments who are also going through difficult times and cannot help it with the current situation. Last Friday's riots were unacceptable and the city council strongly condemned the violence. There should be no further escalation in which bystanders are harmed. St.Gallen should remain peaceful. The St.Gallen City Police will be present, prosecute criminal behavior and bring people to justice. There is another way The last Saturday proved that young people can maintain social contacts peacefully despite the police presence. Around 150 young people met in small groups all over the Red Square. The evening was peaceful and the police did not have to intervene. The various places throughout the city of St.Gallen may and should be used within the framework of the current regulations. Young people are allowed to meet in groups of up to 15 people. Maintaining the contacts does not need violence.
180;Riots in the city of St.Gallen;On Friday evening (April 2nd, 2021), violence broke out in the city of St.Gallen after previous calls. Police and ambulance forces were attacked. Fortunately, the emergency services were not injured, but the police are aware of at least two injured people. There was property damage. 19 people were stopped and brought in for the purpose of investigating criminal offenses. A person who had been advertised was arrested. Following calls for violence on Good Friday in the city of St.Gallen in the past few days, the first clashes broke out on Friday evening shortly after 9 p.m. What began peacefully on Red Square at 8 p.m. later degenerated into attacks on the police, who were present on site and sought dialogue. Police forces were pelted with bottles, stones, pyro and even a Molotov cocktail. Rubber shot had to be used in self-defense. In the course of the evening there was various damage to property and the police finally used irritant gas in addition to rubber shot. Among other things, objects were set on fire, furniture was damaged and, for example, a pane of a bus stop was smashed. Police and ambulance forces were attacked. Fortunately, the emergency services were not injured, but the police are aware of at least two injured people. 19 people were brought in to investigate criminal offenses. 33 people were expelled from the city of St.Gallen (28 people for 30 days and five people for 24 hours).

The St.Gallen canton police had received around seven reports of property damage by noon on Saturday. The amount of damage currently amounts to around CHF 50,000. Rescue forces and resources The St.Gallen City Police was supported by the St.Gallen Canton Police and rescue forces from the Eastern Switzerland Police Concordat as well as the SBB Transport Police.

Information is received on 071 224 60 00 or mailbox.polizei@stadt.sg.ch. Condemnation of the violence The city of St.Gallen and the city police condemn the renewed violence in the strongest possible terms. The corona measures are drastic, especially for young people. However, this in no way justifies the violence against the emergency services and the damage to property. It is important to keep calm and persevere in the further course of the pandemic.
181;Action by the police as a result of renewed calls for violence;For Easter Sunday evening (April 4th, 2021) there will be another call for violence in the city of St.Gallen. It is important to the City Council and the St.Gallen City Police that the public is aware of the police action. Furthermore, neither violence nor damage to property will be tolerated. Extensive personal controls take place on Sunday evening. The aim is to turn away people who are looking for a riot or who are onlookers following the calls for violence. After two Friday evenings with riots in the city of St.Gallen, calls for violence are already circulating again for Easter Sunday evening. It is important to the City Council and the St.Gallen City Police that the public is aware of the police's procedures and that young people in particular are aware of what they are getting into if they follow the calls for violence Personal checks are carried out and young people who are looking for a riot or who follow the calls for violence as onlookers are turned away at an early stage. These personal controls must be expected in the entire city center. Anyone who violates an outright signposting will be reported. Those people who were turned away last Friday, if they are in the city of St.Gallen again this evening, must also expect a criminal complaint follow, not even as onlookers. The appeal is aimed in particular at the parents of the young people: Don't let your children go to St.Gallen this evening. There are peaceful and therefore more expedient ways of attracting attention to the concerns of young people.
182;Balance of the police operation in St.Gallen;"For Easter Sunday evening (April 4th, 2021), violence was called for the third time in the city of St.Gallen within a few days. The city police therefore announced in advance extensive identity checks and the removal of people who followed the calls for violence or who wanted to witness the riots as onlookers. The city police draws a positive balance. There were no riots, no injuries and property damage was largely prevented. Various prohibited items were seized as a precautionary measure to prevent possible criminal offenses. After violence was called for the third time in the city of St.Gallen for the third time within a few days for Easter Sunday evening, the police, as announced in advance, carried out extensive personal checks. People who followed the calls for violence or wanted to witness possible riots as onlookers were turned away. A total of around 500 people were turned away between 6 p.m. and 1 a.m. As a result of various personal checks, 60 people were brought in and investigations into possible criminal offenses were carried out. The most important thing in a nutshell: stopping a group of people who were carrying 2.5 liters of fuel and small, empty bottles that could presumably have served as Molotov cocktails; stopping a person who was carrying fuel; securing various pyro, various masking material and a knife25 The police did not have to use rubber shot or irritant gas. There were no riots, no people were injured and property damage was largely prevented. This succeeded in stopping the dynamic of calls for violence for the city of St.Gallen for the time being. Proportionality of the deploymentThe city council and the St.Gallen city police are aware that the many evictions also raise questions. After violence was called for the third time in social media and in chats and there were already two massive riots despite the willingness to engage in dialogue and the initially cautious police operation, the evictions were considered proportionate in this extraordinary situation. The past riots were not violations of the Covid-19 regulation, but in some cases violence against emergency services and property damage that had been specifically prepared in advance. The consideration of expelling people from the city or accepting further injuries and property damage was carefully carried out. The identity checks and evictions were clearly communicated in advance. Thanks to fewer people in the public space due to the directional instructions, targeted personal checks and the resulting bring-in were only possible throughout the evening. This enabled the police to prevent riots, injured people and, to a large extent, damage to property. Legal basis and effects of evictionsThe police can temporarily evict or keep people away from a location if there is reasonable suspicion that they or the gathering to which they can be attributed that endanger or disrupt public safety and order. This was due to two recent calls for violence, both of which resulted in rioting, injured people and property damage Perimeter (city center / Drei Weieren). The evictions do not prevent affected persons from moving to work, school or the like in the city of St.Gallen, unless there is a call for violence during this period."
183;Dealing with directions;The numerous evictions on Easter Sunday evening (April 4th, 2021) raise questions, and some of those affected also resentment. The St.Gallen City Police are ready to talk should a removal order have been wrongly ordered. The final balance with regard to the number of evictions for Easter Sunday amounts to 650 evictions, 150 more than originally reported. For Easter Sunday, a third night of rioting had to be expected within a few days. The primary goal of the St.Gallen city council and city police was to prevent further riots with injuries and property damage. The police law allows people to be expelled if there is a suspicion that they are endangering public safety and order. So that the directions also have an effect for further calls, as they are now circulating again for Friday, April 9, 2021, they have been decreed for the maximum duration of 30 days possible by law. The aim is to be able to report people who repeatedly take part in riots due to disregard of the ordered directions. However, nobody should be prevented from attending school or work, important errands or using the public transport, as long as there are no calls for violence during this period. Accordingly, it was pointed out that people who believe they had been unjustly evicted should report to the St.Gallen City Police (mailbox.polizei@stadt.sg.ch). Around a dozen people registered by Tuesday evening, April 6, 2021. While there was no time on site to hold long discussions, it is now possible afterwards to assess individual cases in more detail depending on the situation. Any questions about evictions can be clarified or, in justified cases, evictions can be lifted. A total of around 650 evictionsWhile the balance sheet press release after the end of the mission on Easter Monday morning (April 5th, 2021) communicates around 500 evictions for the time between 6 p.m. and 1 a.m. the final number, around 650 signposts, can now be confirmed.
184;Police action on Friday evening;On Friday evening (April 9th, 2021) there will be another call to violence for the city of St.Gallen. Furthermore, neither violence nor damage to property will be tolerated. As a result, the St.Gallen city police are again carrying out extensive personal checks on Friday evening. On the one hand, compliance with the directions is checked. On the other hand, people who are looking for a riot or who follow the calls for violence as bystanders are turned away. After two Friday evenings with riots in the city of St.Gallen, the city police turned away around 650 people for 30 days on Easter Sunday. The goal of preventing further violence was achieved. Calls for violence are again circulating for Friday, April 9, 2021. The city and city police of St.Gallen are taking this seriously and are preparing accordingly. Renewed identity checks and evictions On Friday, extensive identity checks will again be carried out in order to determine possible disregard of evictions. People who have been ordered to evacuate are explicitly not allowed to stay in the city of St.Gallen on Friday evening (April 9th, 2021). Otherwise they will be reported. In addition, on Friday evening, expulsion orders will again be issued against people if there is any suspicion that they are looking for a riot or are onlookers who follow the calls for violence. The city council and the St.Gallen city police again appeal to the population not to heed the calls to violence, not even as bystanders.
185;Record of the police operation on April 9, 2021;On Friday evening (April 9th, 2021) there were renewed calls for violence for the city of St.Gallen. The St.Gallen City Police were prepared accordingly. There were neither riots nor property damage.

After violence was called for the fourth time within two weeks in St.Gallen on Friday evening, April 9, 2021, the St.Gallen City Police were again prepared accordingly. Extensive personal controls and, if necessary, evictions were announced in advance. From the point of view of the police, Friday evening was mostly calm and there were neither riots nor damage to property. Around 40 people were brought in between 6 p.m. and midnight. Almost all of these are disregard for signposts. A alarm gun, masking material and various narcotics were seized during the controls. Over a dozen of the around 40 people brought in were minors, which is why the parents were informed afterwards to pick up the minors. Very few of the people brought in are resident in the city of St.Gallen. Again, around 90 people were evicted between 6 p.m. and midnight. Around a third are minors. There are hardly any people who live in St.Gallen among those evicted. In addition to people from eastern Switzerland, those who were directed also include people from Bern, Kriens, Lucerne and Landquart.

As part of the introduction of e-bikes, the e-scooter will also be replaced by the latest model, which, in addition to the integrated helmet solution, also has indicators that are intended to ensure even more safety on the road."
200;Lack of oxygen in the coffee roastery;On Wednesday morning (09/28/2021) there was an accident at work in a coffee roastery. One employee had two coffee grinders in operation, which released more CO2 than normal, resulting in a lack of oxygen. Five employees had to be brought to the hospital to be on the safe side. Last Wednesday, shortly before eleven, there was an accident at work in a coffee roastery in St.Gallen. An employee was grinding coffee. However, since two machines were in operation, and not one, as is usually the case, more CO2 was released, which led to a lack of oxygen in the relevant rooms. The 57-year-old employee who operated the mills passed out as a result and had to receive medical care on site. A total of five employees were brought to the hospital for an inspection. When coffee is ground, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released in addition to other ingredients. Since the quantities of ground coffee in roasting plants are significantly larger than in private use, the CO2 values ​​are correspondingly higher. How the lack of oxygen came about is the subject of further clarifications.

The adaptation work will start on May 17, 2021 and will be completed by the beginning of June 2021. Today, with the exception of the Appenzeller Bahnen, Bahnhofstrasse is operated as a one-way street towards the train station. For cyclists traveling in the east direction, from the train station to the market square, this traffic regime leads to an unattractive detour via Poststrasse and Oberen Graben. With the implementation of immediate measures, Bahnhofstrasse can be opened to cyclists. For this purpose, provisional roadside adjustments will be made on two short sections so that cyclists will have enough space between the tracks of the Appenzeller Bahnen and the roadside.

243;The ban on music on the Drei Weieren is lifted;The music ban on the Drei Weieren, which was stipulated in the bathing regulations, triggered various questions and uncertainties. Since the Drei Weieren is a bathing establishment, the house rules of the baths apply during opening times. Outside the supervised bathing times, the general regulations apply due to the publicly accessible area. In order to standardize practice, the music ban will be lifted. As of May 2021, all bathing regulations for the municipal outdoor pools were amended. The aim was to standardize the rules in the municipal bathing establishments. Playing music and playing musical instruments, as in the other public bathing establishments in the city of St.Gallen, was forbidden. The Mannenweier was mistakenly taken into account in the implementation. This regulation raised various questions and uncertainties. The Mannenweier is a special case due to its public accessibility. Because of this, the city council has discussed the issue and the legal basis with the responsible departments. Situation Drei WeierenIn the area of ​​the Mannenweiers it is a publicly accessible area which can be entered at any time. In this perimeter between Möslengut and Milchhüslidamm, bathing is supervised daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. during the season. It is therefore up to the operating staff to control and enforce the bathing regulations. A collection of fines by the police based on the bathing regulations is not possible. Outside of business hours, the St.Gallen City Police are responsible for enforcing general regulations, such as the immission control regulations. Buses Since the start of the season, the police have issued around 20 buses. Most of the buses were after 10 p.m. Only a few complaints arose during the daytime. It is currently still being clarified whether buses were issued based on the general music ban. If this is the case, the St.Gallen city police will check in each individual case whether the bus is withdrawn. The music ban is lifted accordingly. Playing music and playing musical instruments is generally permitted, provided that no one feels disturbed by it. In the event of excessive noise pollution, the St.Gallen City Police can impose a fine of CHF 60. The police always seek a dialogue before a fine is pronounced. In extreme cases of loud music, however, a fine must be expected.
244;Exchange on the Bermuda Triangle;On Thursday, June 24th, 2021, various people involved met for a round table. The noise and waste issue around the Bermuda Triangle was discussed.

Now the situation was discussed with representatives of residents, property owners, the neighborhood association, the street society, restaurants and municipal departments - civil engineering office, waste disposal, children, youth, family, environment and energy and the St.Gallen city police. The aim was to inform each other about the situation and the legal options as well as to exchange ideas about possible solutions. Difficult situation for everyone In the last few weeks, the Bermuda Triangle has established itself as a meeting point for party guests, where alcohol that has been brought along is consumed and parties are held with private speakers . The noise, the dirt left behind, the urinating on house facades as well as the reckless and aggressive behavior of some guests is intolerable for all those present at the round table. On the occasion of the exchange, possible measures such as the introduction of a reusable cup system or the closure of Augustinergasse were discussed. Such measures are now being examined. Measure for the coming weekend The measures from last weekend will also be continued on this Friday and Saturday. This includes prevention posters, barriers and additional waste containers. The City Police of St.Gallen will increase their presence again according to human resources. In addition, Augustinergasse will be closed over the weekend in order to minimize sources of noise for residents. An extension of the opening times of catering establishments is generally again approved for objection-free restaurants.

The population is invited to take part in an online survey by mid-August. Based on the knowledge gained, discussion rounds are then planned with the population and associations. Micromobility includes motorized and non-motorized micro and light vehicles that are characterized by their compact and lightweight construction and are designed for individual passenger transport. This includes, for example, bicycles, e-bikes, e-scooters or e-cargo bikes. In St.Gallen, too, these are increasingly part of the cityscape. But for which routes do the people of St.Gallen use these vehicles, can they replace car journeys and how can the micro-vehicles be connected to the train and bus? The Institute for Mobility at the University of St.Gallen (IMO-HSG) and the City of St.Gallen are investigating these and other questions about the integration of micromobility in a cooperation project. In the project, 17 cities in different countries are examined in detail. Clevermobil combined to the goal The urban energy concept and also the mobility concept rely on the promotion of bicycle traffic and public transport as well as combined mobility, among other things. This is why the question of how the various micro-vehicles, as young forms of individual urban transport, can be sustainably integrated into the existing transport systems and mobility patterns of the population is also of interest. The use of micromobility is particularly useful for the so-called last mile, for example between the public transport stop and the workplace. It is interested in whether and under what conditions the micro-mobility forms can be meaningfully integrated into the existing mobility offer and how this can be further developed. Interested parties can take part in an online survey until August 16, 2021. On the basis of the knowledge gained, roundtables will be held in late summer with interested citizens, professional associations and interest groups in order to discuss and incorporate suggestions for the sustainable integration of micromobility.
