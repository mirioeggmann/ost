## Basline for this lab:
- [In-Depth: Support Vector Machines \| Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.07-support-vector-machines.html)

## Useful:
- [kernel trick - How to understand effect of RBF SVM - Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/58585/how-to-understand-effect-of-rbf-svm)

- [RBF](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~matthewb/pages/notes/pdf/svms/RBFKernel.pdf)

- [Support Vector Machine Python Example - Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-python-example-d67d9b63f1c8)

## Notes:
- exercise_4 is not that beautiful. The used baseline creates something similar to an rbf. An actual rbf would map into infinite dimensions --> not plotable. The students should get a feel of how data becomes separable in higher dimension. Therefore they should create an artificial 3D dimension. It must be made clear that that is not what happens using SVM with rbf.
